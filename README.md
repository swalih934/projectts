Project Description
This Task Manager application is designed to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks and projects. It allows users to add, update, toggle completion status, and delete tasks with ease through a clean, responsive interface. Built with React for the frontend and Node.js with Express and MongoDB for the backend, this project demonstrates full-stack development skills including RESTful API design, state management, and asynchronous operations. The app supports real-time updates to the task list and provides a smooth user experience across desktop and mobile devices.

This project is a simple yet effective Task Manager web application built with React and Express.js. It consists of two main pages: a welcoming homepage and a tasks page. The tasks page displays a table of projects with options to add new projects via a modal form, edit existing entries, and delete projects. Added tasks instantly appear in the table for easy tracking. The clean UI and responsive design make it user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
